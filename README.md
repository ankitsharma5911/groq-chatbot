## Customization

### Change Model

You can modify the available models in the `selected_model` dropdown by editing the `app.py` file:

```python
selected_model = st.selectbox(
    "Choose Model",
    ["mixtral-8x7b-32768", "llama2-70b-4096"],  # Add or remove models here
    index=0
)
```

### Modify System Prompt

Update the system prompt in the `app.py` file to customize the AI's behavior:

```python
system_prompt = SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
    "You are an expert AI coding assistant. Provide concise, correct solutions "
    "with strategic print statements for debugging. Always respond in English."
)
```
